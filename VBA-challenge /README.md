## VBA challenge

This challenge used VBA to create a stock market analysis function.

Function name: 
    stock_checker()
Function description:
    The stock_checker() function groups metrics by ticker label and calculates the yearly change, percentage change and total stock volume for each of these grouped stocks.
    The stock with the greatest increase, greatest decrease and greatest total stock volume is also filtered from the results.
    The function loops through multiple sheets of data and applies the same calculations.
    Buttons to "Calculate results" and "Clear results" were added to the first excel sheet.
